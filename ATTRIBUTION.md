## AI Assistance Disclosure
I used the help of ChatGPT as a writing assistant for clarifying ideas, brainstorming next steps, and improving explanations in documentation. I also justed ChatGPT during the development to help me with debugging issues and editing and improving my written explanations in documentation. All use of AI was reviewed and adapted by me and I take responsibility for the code that I wrote.
